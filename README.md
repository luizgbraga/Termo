# Termo

This repository contains the code for a simpler version for the globally famous game Termo, or Wordle.
Basically, you must guess the right randomly generated word on a limited number of tries. The game helps you by giving information about the relationship between the letters you tried
and the letters of the right word, like position or presence in it.
